# Class-Scheduling
This system is needed to help colleges when students are registering for classes. Its intention is to present available classes and times to which the student can add to their future semester schedule. It is beneficial to the college institutions since it eliminates the need for written documents and the process is done quicker and the students will be aware of the classes offered quickly and easily. This earns the institution profits from classes enrolled in. The Requirements Document is crucial to this project since it lists all the necessary information needed to complete it. This project is intended to be versatile but small and effective so it is adaptable and marketable. Compare with CunyFirst, this system can be more easily arrange student schedule.
